            <li>1-2 fresh Thai bird chili peppers <em>(thinly sliced)</em></li>

            <li>1/2 - 1 1/2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns <em>(powdered or finely ground)</em></li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ginger <em>(finely minced)</em></li>
            <li>3 tablespoons garlic <em>(finely minced)</em></li>
            <li>8 ounces ground pork <em>(225g)</em></li>
            <li>1-2 tablespoons spicy bean sauce</li>
            <li>2/3 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pound silken tofu</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 scallion <em>(finely chopped)</em></li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>First, toast the chilies. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. Add 1/4 
                cup of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally and heat
                until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don't burn. Remove from
                heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remainin 1/4 cup of oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger. After
                1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high
                and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and fry it until it's cooked through.
                Add your ground Sichaun peppercorns and stir for about 15-30 seconds, taking care
                to not let it burn, as it will turn bitter if it does.</li>
            <li>Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Add 2/3 cups of chicken
                broth to the wok and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening,
                ready your tofu and also put a 1/4 cup fo water in a small bowl with your cornstarch
                and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
            <li>Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce
                starts to thicken. (If it gets too thick, splash in a little more water or
                chicken stock).</li>
            <li>Then add your chili oil from before-peppers and all! If you are using homemade chili
                oil, <strong>ONLY</strong> use the standing oil, as it's likely that you have salted
                it and you only want the oil, not additional salt. stir the oil into the sauce, and 
                add the tofu. Use your spatual to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. Let everything cook
                for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar (if using) along with the scallions and 
                stir until the scallions are just wilted.</li>
            <li>Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichaun peppercorn powder as a garnish if desired.</li>
