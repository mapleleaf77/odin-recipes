        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>This chinese green beans recipe is unique because the green beans are flash fried.
            This will quickly blister a thin layer of skin and cause it to wrinkle. The center 
            will be nice and tender! Enjoy!</p>
        
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>1 pound green beans <em>(rinsed and dried)</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup safflower or vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic <em>(about 5 to 6 plump cloves)</em></li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic salt or kosher salt</li>
        </ul></p>
        
        <p><h4>Optional Garnish</h4></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Snap off the touch ends of the green beans. If your green beans are very
                long, snap them in half.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. To check to see if the oil is hot
                enough, stick bamboo chopsticks in the wok so that the tips of the chopsticks are
                touching the bottom. You want to see tiny bubbles rapidly forming around the chopsticks.
                Alternatively, you can throw a green bean into the wok. If bubbles start to form around
                bean immediately, the oil is ready for frying.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry the green beans for about 2 minutes, until the green beans start 
                to wrinkle on the outside. You don't need to cook the green beans for too long. Use a spider
                 strainer to strain the oil from the beans and then transfer them to a plate lined with paper 
                 towels. Repeat until all the beans are fried. Turn off the heat. If you want the beans to be 
                 less greasy, blot them with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Carefully pour the used frying oil into a bowl. If you do not want to handle hot oil, let the 
                oil cool completely in the wok. Don't bother wiping the wok at this point because you'll be 
                using it to fry the garlic next, and you can use the residual oil in the wok for that.</li>
            <li>Heat the wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and cook it for about 30 seconds to
                 1 minute, until fragrant. Add the green beans back to the wok, along with the salt. Stir to 
                 combine. Cook for another minute. Turn off the heat and transfer the green beans to a 
                 serving plate. Garnish the beans with red pepper flakes and toasted sesame seeds, if you 
                 like.</li>
